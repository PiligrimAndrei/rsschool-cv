### ABOUT ME:
Graduated from Vitebsk State University, Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, and worked for 2 years as a teacher of physics, mathematics and computer science. After that, I worked in the tourism sector for 22 years. 
As a student, I programmed in Pascal and Assembler. 
While working in tourism I created a database in MS Access with an interface and SQL queries. Occasionally I designed the website https://www.mega-tour.by 
I always had a dream to learn programming, I think I can do it with a mathematical type of mind.
